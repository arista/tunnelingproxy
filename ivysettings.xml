  <!-- Defines how dependences should be resolved.  By default, we use
       the "ibiblio" resolver, which resolves dependencies from the
       maven repository.  Other resolvers can be added here if some
       libraries are not found in maven.  If we want to set up our own
       repository so that we are not dependent on maven.org, we would
       direct this file to point to our repository instead of
       maven's. -->
